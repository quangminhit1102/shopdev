# Top NoSQL Interview Questions for Backend Development

## Basic NoSQL Concepts

### 1. What is NoSQL and how does it differ from relational databases?

**Answer:** NoSQL ("Not Only SQL") refers to non-relational database systems designed for distributed data stores that require large-scale data storage and processing. Unlike traditional relational databases that use structured query language (SQL) and store data in tables with predefined schemas, NoSQL databases use various data models including document, key-value, column-family, and graph formats.

Key differences include:

- Schema flexibility (schema-less or dynamic schema vs. rigid schemas)
- Horizontal scalability (easier to scale out across servers)
- Different consistency models (often sacrificing ACID for BASE properties)
- Optimized for specific data models and access patterns rather than general-purpose use

### 2. What are the main types of NoSQL databases?

**Answer:** There are four primary types of NoSQL databases:

1. **Document Databases**: Store data in flexible, JSON-like documents (e.g., MongoDB, CouchDB)
2. **Key-Value Stores**: Simple stores that pair keys with values (e.g., Redis, DynamoDB)
3. **Column-Family Stores**: Store data in column families or tables with rows and dynamic columns (e.g., Cassandra, HBase)
4. **Graph Databases**: Optimize storage and querying of highly connected data (e.g., Neo4j, ArangoDB)

### 3. Explain CAP theorem and its significance in NoSQL database selection

**Answer:** The CAP theorem, proposed by Eric Brewer, states that a distributed database system can only guarantee two out of these three properties simultaneously:

- **Consistency**: Every read receives the most recent write or an error
- **Availability**: Every request receives a non-error response (but not necessarily the most recent data)
- **Partition Tolerance**: The system continues to operate despite network partitions

NoSQL databases make different trade-offs among these properties:

- MongoDB prioritizes CP (Consistency and Partition Tolerance)
- Cassandra prioritizes AP (Availability and Partition Tolerance)
- Redis can be configured for CP or AP depending on deployment

Understanding these trade-offs is crucial when selecting a NoSQL database for specific use cases.

## NoSQL Data Modeling

### 4. How does data modeling differ between SQL and NoSQL databases?

**Answer:** SQL data modeling focuses on normalization to reduce redundancy and ensure data integrity through relationships between tables. NoSQL data modeling often employs denormalization to optimize for read performance and specific access patterns.

Key differences:

- SQL modeling is relationship-oriented; NoSQL modeling is query-oriented
- SQL enforces a predefined schema; NoSQL allows flexible schemas
- SQL uses joins to connect related data; NoSQL often embeds related data
- NoSQL typically requires understanding access patterns upfront to optimize data organization

### 5. What are embedding and referencing in document databases?

**Answer:** In document databases like MongoDB, there are two main approaches to represent relationships:

**Embedding (denormalization)**: Storing related data in the same document

```json
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "address": {
    "street": "123 Main St",
    "city": "San Francisco",
    "zipcode": "94105"
  }
}
```

**Referencing (normalization)**: Storing references to documents in other collections

```json
// User document
{
  "user_id": "123",
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "address_id": "456"
}

// Address document
{
  "address_id": "456",
  "street": "123 Main St",
  "city": "San Francisco",
  "zipcode": "94105"
}
```

The choice depends on:

- Query patterns (frequent vs. infrequent access to related data)
- Update frequency of related data
- Size constraints (documents in MongoDB are limited to 16MB)
- Consistency requirements

## Performance and Scaling

### 6. How do NoSQL databases achieve horizontal scalability?

**Answer:** NoSQL databases achieve horizontal scalability through:

1. **Sharding**: Distributing data across multiple servers based on a partition key
2. **Replication**: Creating data copies across multiple nodes for redundancy and load distribution
3. **Distributed architecture**: Using a peer-to-peer model rather than client-server
4. **Consistent Hashing**: Efficiently mapping data to nodes, minimizing redistribution when nodes are added or removed
5. **Auto-scaling**: Dynamically adding or removing nodes based on load

This architecture allows NoSQL systems to scale out by adding more commodity servers rather than scaling up with more powerful hardware.

### 7. What are the indexing strategies in NoSQL databases?

**Answer:** Indexing strategies vary across NoSQL database types:

**Document Databases (MongoDB)**:

- Single-field indexes
- Compound indexes (multiple fields)
- Multi-key indexes (for array fields)
- Geospatial indexes
- Text indexes
- Hashed indexes

**Key-Value Stores**:

- Primary key indexing only
- Some offer secondary indexes (like DynamoDB's GSI and LSI)

**Column-Family Stores (Cassandra)**:

- Primary key consists of partition key and clustering columns
- Secondary indexes with limitations
- Materialized views

**Graph Databases**:

- Node labels and relationship types
- Property indexes

Each strategy has performance implications and understanding these is crucial for optimizing queries.

### 8. Explain how caching works with NoSQL databases

**Answer:** Caching with NoSQL databases can occur at multiple levels:

1. **Internal caching**: Many NoSQL databases have built-in caching mechanisms:

   - MongoDB uses the WiredTiger storage engine with an internal cache
   - Redis is primarily an in-memory data store that acts as a cache itself

2. **Application-level caching**:

   - Implementing a cache layer with tools like Redis or Memcached
   - Cache-aside pattern: application checks cache first, then database
   - Write-through/write-behind caching: updates go to cache and propagate to database

3. **Query-result caching**:
   - Storing results of frequently executed queries
   - Invalidation strategies based on time or data changes

Effective caching strategies can dramatically improve read performance and reduce database load.

## NoSQL Implementation

### 9. What considerations are important when choosing a NoSQL database for a project?

**Answer:** Key considerations include:

1. **Data model fit**: Match between your data structure and the database's data model
2. **Query patterns**: Types of queries your application will perform
3. **Write vs. read ratio**: Some NoSQL databases optimize for writes, others for reads
4. **Scalability needs**: Current and projected data volume and traffic
5. **Consistency requirements**: Strong vs. eventual consistency needs
6. **Operational complexity**: Management overhead and operational expertise required
7. **Community and ecosystem**: Available drivers, tools, and community support
8. **Cost considerations**: Open-source vs. commercial, hosting options
9. **Integration with existing tools**: Compatibility with your stack

The best choice often depends on specific application requirements rather than a one-size-fits-all approach.

### 10. How would you implement transactions in NoSQL databases that don't natively support ACID?

**Answer:** Implementing transactions in non-ACID NoSQL databases:

1. **Application-level transactions**:

   - Implement compensating transactions to roll back changes if errors occur
   - Use version flags or timestamps to detect conflicts
   - Apply changes in a specific order to maintain consistency

2. **Optimistic concurrency control**:

   - Check version numbers or timestamps before updating
   - Retry operations if conflicts are detected

3. **Two-phase commit patterns**:

   - Use a separate collection/table to track transaction status
   - Implement prepare and commit phases

4. **Event sourcing**:

   - Store sequences of events rather than current state
   - Rebuild state from event history for consistency

5. **Using native features when available**:
   - MongoDB offers multi-document transactions
   - DynamoDB provides transactional APIs

These approaches involve trade-offs between performance, complexity, and consistency guarantees.

## MongoDB-Specific Questions

### 11. Explain MongoDB's aggregation framework

**Answer:** MongoDB's aggregation framework is a powerful tool for data processing and analysis that works on multiple documents. It uses a pipeline approach where each stage transforms the data and passes it to the next stage:

```javascript
db.orders.aggregate([
  { $match: { status: "completed" } },
  { $group: { _id: "$customer_id", totalSpent: { $sum: "$total" } } },
  { $sort: { totalSpent: -1 } },
]);
```

Common aggregation stages include:

- `$match`: Filters documents
- `$group`: Groups documents by specified fields
- `$project`: Reshapes documents
- `$sort`: Sorts documents
- `$limit` and `$skip`: Pagination
- `$lookup`: Performs left outer joins with other collections
- `$unwind`: Deconstructs array fields
- `$facet`: Creates multi-faceted aggregations

The framework provides SQL-like analytical capabilities while maintaining MongoDB's flexibility.

### 12. How does MongoDB ensure high availability and fault tolerance?

**Answer:** MongoDB ensures high availability through:

1. **Replica Sets**:

   - A group of MongoDB instances that maintain the same data set
   - Automatic failover if the primary node becomes unavailable
   - Self-healing recovery when failed nodes return to service
   - Secondary nodes can serve read operations to distribute load

2. **Distributed Architecture**:

   - Data is distributed across multiple shards
   - Each shard is typically a replica set for redundancy

3. **Write Concerns**:

   - Configure acknowledgment requirements for write operations
   - Options range from unacknowledged to majority confirmation

4. **Read Preferences**:

   - Configure which nodes serve read operations
   - Options include primary, primaryPreferred, secondary, secondaryPreferred, nearest

5. **Monitoring and Automation**:
   - Built-in monitoring tools
   - Integration with third-party monitoring solutions

These mechanisms provide resilience against hardware failures, network issues, and maintenance events.

## Redis-Specific Questions

### 13. What are Redis data structures and their use cases?

**Answer:** Redis offers several specialized data structures:

1. **Strings**: Simple key-value pairs

   - Use case: Caching, counters, simple values

2. **Lists**: Ordered collections of strings

   - Use case: Message queues, recent activity timelines

3. **Sets**: Unordered collections of unique strings

   - Use case: Tracking unique items, tag systems

4. **Sorted Sets**: Sets with score-based ordering

   - Use case: Leaderboards, priority queues, time-series data

5. **Hashes**: Maps between string fields and values

   - Use case: Representing objects, user profiles

6. **Bitmaps**: String operations treating strings as bit arrays

   - Use case: Efficient counting for status tracking

7. **HyperLogLog**: Probabilistic data structure for cardinality estimation

   - Use case: Counting unique visitors with minimal memory

8. **Streams**: Append-only collections

   - Use case: Event sourcing, activity feeds

9. **Geospatial indexes**: Store and query location data
   - Use case: Location-based applications

Each structure has specific commands optimized for its use case.

### 14. How would you implement caching strategies with Redis?

**Answer:** Implementing caching strategies with Redis:

1. **Cache-Aside (Lazy Loading)**:

   - Application checks cache first
   - If miss, load from database and update cache

   ```javascript
   // Pseudo-code
   function getData(key) {
     data = redis.get(key);
     if (!data) {
       data = database.get(key);
       redis.set(key, data, "EX", 3600); // 1-hour expiration
     }
     return data;
   }
   ```

2. **Write-Through**:

   - Application writes to cache and database together

   ```javascript
   function saveData(key, value) {
     database.set(key, value);
     redis.set(key, value);
     return success;
   }
   ```

3. **Write-Behind (Write-Back)**:

   - Write to cache immediately
   - Asynchronously update database

   ```javascript
   function saveData(key, value) {
     redis.set(key, value);
     queue.add({ operation: "write", key: key, value: value });
     return success;
   }
   // Worker processes queue and updates database
   ```

4. **Time-To-Live (TTL)**:

   - Set expiration on cache entries

   ```javascript
   redis.set("user:1001", userData, "EX", 1800); // 30 minutes
   ```

5. **Eviction Policies**:
   - Configure Redis with appropriate maxmemory-policy
   - Options include: volatile-lru, allkeys-lru, volatile-ttl

Each strategy has implications for data consistency, latency, and resource usage.

## Cassandra-Specific Questions

### 15. Explain Cassandra's data model and how it differs from other NoSQL databases

**Answer:** Cassandra's data model has several distinctive characteristics:

1. **Column-Family Structure**:

   - Data organized in tables (column families)
   - Each row identified by a primary key
   - Columns can be added dynamically per row

2. **Distributed Design**:

   - Masterless architecture with no single point of failure
   - Data distributed across nodes using consistent hashing of partition key

3. **Query-Driven Modeling**:

   - Tables designed around specific query patterns
   - No joins or subqueries supported

4. **Compound Primary Keys**:

   - Partition key determines data distribution
   - Clustering columns determine data sorting within partitions

5. **Wide-Row Capability**:
   - Can store billions of columns per row
   - Efficient for time-series and event data

Key differences from other NoSQL databases:

- Unlike MongoDB, doesn't use nested documents
- Unlike Redis, designed for disk persistence rather than in-memory
- Unlike Neo4j, optimized for write throughput over relationship traversal
- Unlike HBase, fully decentralized with no region servers

Cassandra's model is optimized for high write throughput and predictable performance at scale.

### 16. How does Cassandra handle consistency levels?

**Answer:** Cassandra offers tunable consistency levels that define how many replicas must acknowledge read and write operations:

**Write Consistency Levels**:

- `ANY`: Write to any one replica (lowest consistency, highest availability)
- `ONE`: Write to at least one replica and acknowledge
- `QUORUM`: Write to a majority of replicas
- `ALL`: Write to all replicas (highest consistency, lowest availability)
- `LOCAL_QUORUM`: Quorum in the local datacenter
- `EACH_QUORUM`: Quorum in each datacenter

**Read Consistency Levels**:

- `ONE`: Read from one replica
- `QUORUM`: Read from a majority of replicas
- `ALL`: Read from all replicas
- `LOCAL_ONE`: Read from one replica in the local datacenter
- `LOCAL_QUORUM`: Quorum in the local datacenter

The formula for quorum is: `(replication_factor / 2) + 1`

Consistency levels are set per-query, allowing fine-grained control over the consistency-availability trade-off:

```cql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = 'user123' CONSISTENCY QUORUM;
INSERT INTO users (user_id, name) VALUES ('user123', 'John Doe') CONSISTENCY LOCAL_QUORUM;
```

Appropriate consistency levels are chosen based on specific application requirements.

## DynamoDB-Specific Questions

### 17. Explain DynamoDB's partition key and sort key design

**Answer:** DynamoDB uses a primary key system that can be:

1. **Simple Primary Key (Partition Key only)**:

   - Single attribute that uniquely identifies each item
   - Determines the partition where data is stored

   ```
   Table: Users
   Primary Key: user_id
   ```

2. **Composite Primary Key (Partition Key + Sort Key)**:
   - Partition key determines data distribution
   - Sort key organizes items within a partition
   - Items can share the same partition key but must have different sort keys
   ```
   Table: UserOrders
   Partition Key: user_id
   Sort Key: order_date
   ```

Design considerations:

- **Partition key choice**: Should distribute data evenly to avoid hot partitions
- **Sort key design**: Enables range queries and sophisticated access patterns
- **Compound sort keys**: Using prefixes to create hierarchical structures
  ```
  Sort Key: "ORDER#2023-04-01"
  Sort Key: "ORDER#2023-04-01#ITEM#1"
  ```

This key structure enables efficient queries:

- Get exact items using partition key + sort key
- Range queries within a partition using sort key ranges
- Creating one-to-many relationships in a single table

### 18. What are DynamoDB's Global Secondary Indexes (GSI) and Local Secondary Indexes (LSI)?

**Answer:** DynamoDB offers two types of secondary indexes:

**Local Secondary Indexes (LSI)**:

- Must be created when table is created (cannot add later)
- Uses the same partition key as the base table but a different sort key
- Shares provisioned throughput with the base table
- Strong consistency option available
- Limited to 10GB per partition key value
- Can only be created on tables with composite primary keys

```
Table: UserOrders
Primary Key: {user_id (partition), order_date (sort)}
LSI: {user_id (partition), total_amount (sort)}
```

**Global Secondary Indexes (GSI)**:

- Can be created or deleted any time
- Can have different partition and sort keys from the base table
- Has its own provisioned throughput
- Only eventual consistency
- No size limitation per partition key
- Up to 20 GSIs per table (default limit)

```
Table: UserOrders
Primary Key: {user_id (partition), order_date (sort)}
GSI: {product_id (partition), order_date (sort)}
```

GSIs provide flexible query capabilities but with eventual consistency trade-offs, while LSIs offer stronger consistency but with less flexibility and storage limitations.

## Advanced Topics

### 19. How do you approach data migration or schema evolution in NoSQL databases?

**Answer:** Data migration and schema evolution approaches in NoSQL:

1. **Document Databases (MongoDB)**:

   - **Incremental Migration**: Update documents incrementally as they're accessed

   ```javascript
   // Example: Add a new field with a default value
   db.users.updateMany(
     { new_field: { $exists: false } },
     { $set: { new_field: "default" } }
   );
   ```

   - **Versioning**: Add schema version field to documents

   ```javascript
   // Update schema version during migration
   db.users.updateMany(
     { schema_version: 1 },
     { $set: { new_field: "default", schema_version: 2 } }
   );
   ```

   - **Dual-write Pattern**: Write to both old and new schemas during transition

2. **DynamoDB Approaches**:

   - **GSI Overloading**: Create new GSIs for new access patterns
   - **Item Evolution**: Add new attributes to existing items
   - **Table Cloning**: Create new table with new schema and migrate data

3. **Cassandra Approaches**:

   - **Add New Columns**: Add columns to existing tables
   - **Create New Tables**: Create new tables for new query patterns
   - **Dual-write Strategy**: Write to both old and new structures

4. **General Strategies**:
   - **Application-level Transformation**: Handle schema differences in application code
   - **ETL Processes**: Extract, transform, and load data in batches
   - **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: Stream changes to maintain consistency

Careful planning, testing, and monitoring are essential during schema migrations to prevent data loss or application issues.

### 20. How would you handle security concerns in NoSQL databases?

**Answer:** Security best practices for NoSQL databases:

1. **Authentication and Access Control**:

   - Use strong authentication mechanisms
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - MongoDB example:
     ```javascript
     db.createUser({
       user: "appUser",
       pwd: "securePassword",
       roles: [{ role: "readWrite", db: "myApp" }],
     });
     ```

2. **Network Security**:

   - Use TLS/SSL for client-server and inter-node communications
   - Implement IP whitelisting
   - Use VPCs and private subnets
   - Enable firewalls to limit port access

3. **Data Encryption**:

   - Encryption at rest (storage level)
   - Encryption in transit (network level)
   - Application-level encryption for sensitive fields

4. **Injection Attack Prevention**:

   - Use parameterized queries
   - Input validation
   - MongoDB example:

     ```javascript
     // Vulnerable:
     db.users.find({ username: req.body.username });

     // Secure:
     db.users.find({ username: sanitize(req.body.username) });
     ```

5. **Auditing and Logging**:

   - Enable audit logging
   - Monitor access patterns
   - Set up alerts for suspicious activities

6. **Configuration Hardening**:

   - Remove default users and databases
   - Disable unnecessary services
   - Regularly update to latest security patches

7. **Data Masking and Tokenization**:
   - Mask or tokenize sensitive data for non-production environments

Each NoSQL database has specific security features and best practices to address these concerns.

### 21. Explain techniques for handling time-series data in NoSQL databases

**Answer:** Time-series data handling techniques:

1. **Document Databases (MongoDB)**:

   - Use date-based collections or partitioning
   - Create compound indexes on timestamp fields
   - Use the MongoDB time-series collections feature (introduced in 5.0)

   ```javascript
   db.createCollection("deviceMetrics", {
     timeseries: {
       timeField: "timestamp",
       metaField: "deviceId",
       granularity: "hours",
     },
   });
   ```

2. **Column-Family Stores (Cassandra)**:

   - Design tables with timestamp as clustering column
   - Use TTL (Time To Live) for automatic data expiration

   ```cql
   CREATE TABLE sensor_data (
     sensor_id text,
     timestamp timestamp,
     temperature float,
     humidity float,
     PRIMARY KEY (sensor_id, timestamp)
   ) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (timestamp DESC);
   ```

3. **Key-Value Stores (Redis)**:

   - Use Sorted Sets with timestamp as score
   - Use Redis Streams for time-series events

   ```
   ZADD temperature:sensor1 1618442400 "22.5"
   ZADD temperature:sensor1 1618442460 "22.7"
   ```

4. **Specialized Time-Series Databases**:

   - TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL extension)
   - InfluxDB
   - Amazon Timestream

5. **Optimization Techniques**:
   - **Downsampling**: Aggregating data at different time granularities
   - **Partitioning**: Breaking data into time-based chunks
   - **Compression**: Using specialized compression for time-series patterns

Each approach involves trade-offs between write performance, query flexibility, and storage efficiency.

## Practical Application Questions

### 22. When would you choose a NoSQL database over a relational database?

**Answer:** NoSQL databases are preferable when:

1. **Data Structure**:

   - Dealing with semi-structured or unstructured data
   - Requirements for flexible or evolving schemas
   - Complex hierarchical data that doesn't fit relational models well

2. **Scalability Needs**:

   - Need for horizontal scaling across many servers
   - Handling very high write throughput
   - Managing extremely large datasets (terabytes to petabytes)

3. **Development Velocity**:

   - Rapid development with changing requirements
   - Agile methodologies requiring frequent schema changes
   - Need to iterate quickly on data model

4. **Distribution Requirements**:

   - Geographically distributed data
   - Multi-region deployments
   - Edge computing scenarios

5. **Specific Data Models**:

   - Graph data with complex relationships (Neo4j)
   - Time-series data with high ingest rates (TimescaleDB)
   - Document-oriented applications (MongoDB)
   - Simple high-throughput key-value operations (Redis)

6. **Cost Considerations**:
   - Need to optimize hardware costs for large-scale deployments
   - Preference for commodity hardware over specialized equipment

Relational databases remain better for:

- Complex transactions requiring ACID properties
- Systems with many complex joins
- Legacy applications built around SQL
- Applications requiring strong data consistency

### 23. How would you design a NoSQL database schema for a social media application?

**Answer:** For a social media application using NoSQL, I would use a multi-model approach:

**User Profiles (Document Store - MongoDB)**:

```json
{
  "user_id": "u123",
  "username": "socialuser",
  "name": "Jane Smith",
  "email": "jane@example.com",
  "bio": "Software engineer and photographer",
  "joined_date": "2023-01-15",
  "profile_pic_url": "https://example.com/pics/jane.jpg",
  "stats": {
    "followers_count": 1250,
    "following_count": 735,
    "posts_count": 142
  }
}
```

**Social Graph (Graph Database - Neo4j)**:

```cypher
CREATE (u:User {id: "u123", username: "socialuser"})
CREATE (f:User {id: "u456", username: "frienduser"})
CREATE (u)-[:FOLLOWS]->(f)
CREATE (u)-[:BLOCKS]->(u789)
```

**Posts/Content (Document Store - MongoDB)**:

```json
{
  "post_id": "p789",
  "user_id": "u123",
  "type": "photo",
  "caption": "Beautiful sunset at the beach",
  "media_urls": ["https://example.com/photos/sunset1.jpg"],
  "created_at": "2023-04-10T18:30:00Z",
  "location": {
    "name": "Venice Beach",
    "coordinates": [-118.4695, 33.985]
  },
  "hashtags": ["sunset", "beach", "photography"],
  "mentions": ["u456"]
}
```

**Timelines/Feeds (Key-Value/Column Store - Cassandra)**:

```cql
CREATE TABLE user_timeline (
  user_id text,
  post_id text,
  created_at timestamp,
  post_type text,
  post_data text,
  PRIMARY KEY (user_id, created_at)
) WITH CLUSTERING ORDER BY (created_at DESC);
```

**Real-time Features (In-memory Store - Redis)**:

```
// Active users
SADD active:users "u123" "u456" "u789"

// Notifications
LPUSH notifications:u123 "u456 liked your post p789"

// Trending hashtags
ZINCRBY trending:hashtags 1 "sunset"
```

**Design Considerations**:

1. **Denormalization** for read performance
2. **Eventual consistency** for social interactions
3. **Caching** frequently accessed data
4. **Sharding** by user ID for horizontal scaling
5. **Counter management** for high-update statistics
6. **TTL** for ephemeral content/features

This design balances performance, flexibility, and scalability needs of a social media application.

### 24. What monitoring and maintenance tasks are important for NoSQL databases in production?

**Answer:** Critical monitoring and maintenance tasks:

1. **Performance Monitoring**:

   - Query performance metrics (latency, throughput)
   - Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)
   - Connection pool metrics
   - Slow query detection and analysis

2. **Capacity Planning**:

   - Storage growth trends
   - Read/write operation trends
   - Index size monitoring
   - Shard balancing and distribution

3. **Health Checks**:

   - Replication lag monitoring

   - Compaction management
   - Garbage collection tuning
   - Rolling upgrades and patches

6. **Security Monitoring**:

   - Authentication failures
   - Authorization exceptions
   - Access pattern anomalies
   - Audit log review

7. **Tools and Approaches**:

   - Database-specific monitoring tools:
     - MongoDB: MongoDB Atlas, MongoDB Ops Manager
     - Cassandra: DataStax OpsCenter
     - Redis: Redis Sentinel, Redis Enterprise
   - General monitoring platforms:
     - Prometheus and Grafana
     - Datadog
     - New Relic
   - Custom monitoring scripts for specialized metrics

8. **Alerting Strategy**:
   - Different alert levels (warning, critical)
   - On-call rotation
   - Runbooks for common issues
   - Automated remediation where possible

Proactive monitoring and maintenance are essential to prevent performance degradation and ensure high availability.

### 25. How do you handle database migrations with zero downtime in NoSQL systems?

**Answer:** Zero-downtime migration strategies for NoSQL databases:

1. **Rolling Upgrades**:

   - Upgrade one node at a time
   - Allow cluster to rebalance between each node
   - Example (Cassandra):
     ```
     1. Disable autocompaction on a node
     2. Drain the node
     3. Stop the node
     4. Upgrade the software
     5. Start the node
     6. Check node status
     7. Enable autocompaction
     8. Move to next node
     ```

2. **Blue-Green Deployment**:

   - Set up entirely new cluster with updated configuration
   - Synchronize data between old and new clusters
   - Test new cluster thoroughly
   - Switch traffic from old to new cluster
   - Keep old cluster as fallback

3. **Dual-Write Pattern**:

   - Application writes to both old and new database
   - Gradually shift reads to new database
   - Verify data consistency between systems
   - Once verified, decommission old system

4. **Shadow Mode**:

   - Send all operations to old system
   - Mirror operations to new system
   - Compare results to validate correctness
   - Switch over when confident

5. **Schema Evolution Techniques**:

   - MongoDB:
     ```javascript
     // Add fields with defaults
     db.collection.updateMany(
       { newField: { $exists: false } },
       { $set: { newField: defaultValue } }
     );
     ```
   - Cassandra:
     ```
     // Add new column
     ALTER TABLE users ADD email text;
     ```

6. **Feature Flags**:

   - Use application-level feature flags
   - Gradually roll out changes to subsets of users
   - Monitor for errors and performance issues
   - Roll back quickly if problems occur

7. **Database Proxies**:
   - Use a database proxy layer
   - Route queries to appropriate database version
   - Handle translation between schemas if needed

These strategies require careful planning, thorough testing, and close monitoring during migration to ensure smooth transitions.
